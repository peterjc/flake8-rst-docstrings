# This is a plugin for flake8, so we require that.
# Our prefixes are not single letter, so we need v3:
flake8 >= 3.0.0

# We use restructuredtext-lint via its Python API,
# https://github.com/twolfson/restructuredtext-lint
# This internally calls docutils for RST validation:
restructuredtext_lint

# docutils uses pygments for parsing code blocks
# (and at the time of writing does not declare this
# as a requirement):
pygments
